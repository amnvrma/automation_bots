# Title:-
###  _Automation bot using Python_
  
# How it works:-
   This is a web automation script which takes your username and password and login into your account with just one click of the program.
   The framework used here is *Selenium* which does some automations for us like clicking the buttons and filling the input fields.
   
   Make a <a href="https://www.chess.com/login">chess.com</a> account if you dont have already to check this script.
   In the script, place your username and password at the place of "Enter your username" and "enter your password" respectively.
   
# Requirements:-
   1.Python should be installed in your system
   
   2.pip should be installed
   
   3.Selenium Chrome Driver executable. Simply download the most recent ZIP file from <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads">here</a>, extract
   the chromedriver.exe executable, and place the executable in  the same directory where your python script is saved.
   
# Usage:-
   Clone this directory to your system using cmd by writing the following commands in cmd or powershell(git should be installed into your system)
   
   ### Step1:-
    pip install selenium
   ### Step2:-
    git clone https://github.com/amnvrma/automation_bots
    
   ### Step3:-
     cd automation_bots
    
   ### Step4:-
    python automation_bot.py
    
 # Note:- 
   ### Make sure the selenium chrome driver is in the same directory where the python script is saved i.e in automation_bots directory.
 
 _Youâ€™ve just finished creating a bot that visits a web page, enters your username and password, and successfully sign you in, automating the whole process to a single click. I know this was a simple demonstration, but the possibilities are endless._
